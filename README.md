# package-resource-test

This repo is just used for unit testing sampctl's ensure feature for packages
that provide resources which are additional files necessary for builds or
runtime.

In this example, the package provides includes via github releases instead of
via the repository itself.

There are also fake plugin binaries in archives for each platform.
